I am an applied computer scientist with a background in complexity theory, large scale distributed systems, probability theory, decision theory and a bunch of other theories which may be biasing my thinking. I have some 20-odd years practical experience.

As a scientist I accept that [all models are wrong, but some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong), and as a hobbyist philosopher I have found myself doubting the very grounding of modern-day physics. The ontology of time.

My intuition (bias? personal experience?) sways me towards the paradigm of [Physical Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_information).
